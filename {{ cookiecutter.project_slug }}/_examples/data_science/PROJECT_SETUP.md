# Project Setup Guide (for mentors)

This guide walks you through the steps to turn the generated scaffold into a
project your students can start working in. You should complete all of these
steps before students begin.

Most of these tasks are good candidates for an AI coding agent (Cursor, Codex,
etc.) — the guide calls out where that's especially effective.

## 1. Set up the data on Box

The project expects data to live in Box so that everyone on the team
(including students working in Docker or on the cluster) can access it from
a single shared location.

### Create the data directory

On [Box](https://uchicago.account.box.com), create a directory in dsi-core/clinic/ called {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}. 

### Populate the data

This scaffold expects two types of data in the data directory:
- **Input data.** This can be any format, provided that it can be loaded into a dictionary with unique keys. It will be loaded, in its entirety, by a `load_input()` (or similarly named) function in io.py.
- **Expected outputs.** This can be any format, provided that it can be loaded into a dictionary with unique keys, but something simple like JSON is ideal for evaluation. It will be loaded, in its entirety, by a `load_expected_output()` (or similarly named) function in io.py. Note that the students' inference routines will be expected to produce outputs in the _exact same format_ as the expected output, so be thoughtful about how you structure this data.

**IMPORTANT:** Note that the input and expected output data **MUST** use the same set of unique keys to identify an aligned set of data points. A single input should match to a single expected output via a unique identifier.

### Update the `.env` files

The generated `.env` and `.env.example` files point `DATA_DIR` to the default
Box mount path. Update them so the path includes your project folder, which will be something like this for you:

```
DATA_DIR=~/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/dsi-core/clinic/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
```

For students, the path will be different, since they only have access to this folder. Update the `.env.example` to match the expected path for students:
```
DATA_DIR=~/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
```

## 2. Refactor the codebase and the tutorial to match the project
  
Use the following prompt to have an AI agent names and argment types in this scaffold to reflect the details of the project.

```
This is a repo scaffold that is used to get students started on data science projects, but it's totally generic and agnostic to the project content beyond that the project involves inference and evaluation. It uses uses generic names — "input," "output," "inference strategy," "evaluator," and so on — as placeholders. It also uses `Any` as a generic type for both inputs and outputs. Please review the codebase and rename them throughout the codebase so that every file, docstring, variable, CLI flag, and tutorial page uses language specific to your project.

Let's update this to be for a specific project: namely, [one sentence project description].

To start, please make the following changes:
- Update the io.py to load the input and output datafiles found in Box at [location of these files]. The loaded data should [describe expected formats, types, etc -- or if you prefer just provide the functions].
- Manually test the loading functions and check to see if they work as expected, and consider the implications before moving on to the next step.
- Take a look through the data files (analyze using pandas or other tools of your choice), and write a DATA.md describing what the files contain, where to find them, and how to load them.
```

After this step, review io.py and DATA.md to see if any refinements are needed to the data or the loading functions. Then use a variation of the following prompt to update the rest of the codebase.

```
Keeping in mind the inputs and outputs as established in io.py and DATA.md, make the following changes:
- Update the Any types for inputs and outputs to be more specific
- Update the classes, functions, and args to have names and types that are specific to this project. I don't want the students to be confused by vague, ambiguous terms like `do_inference`.
- Update the TUTORIAL.md and README.md to reflect the new function/class/arg names and to generally use more specific language to refer to the inputs, outputs, and methods for this project.
- Update the example inference strategy to output a trivial but correctly-typed output, with a TODO indicating what needs to be done to make it a real strategy.
- Remove the existing evaluators and replace them with an evaluator that will compare predicted outputs to expected in a straightforward, possibly facile way (e.g. it can just check if they're identical), with a TODO indicating what improvements may be needed.
```

## 3. Give students access to Box

Each student needs at least **Viewer** (read-only) access to the
`dsi-core/clinic/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/` folder on Box so their
pipeline can load the data. If the pipeline writes output back to Box, they
need **Editor** access to the `output/` sub-folder.

To grant access:

1. Open the folder on Box
2. Click **Share** → **Invite People**
3. Add each student's UChicago email
4. Set the appropriate permission level

Also make sure students have
[Box Drive](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads) installed and syncing
on their machines, so the files appear at the `~/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/`
mount point that `DATA_DIR` points to.

## 4. Write a baseline strategy (optional but recommended)

It can be hard to tell if the scaffold is really working, even as a starting point, without implementing a baseline inference strategy that at least sort of works. This can be done with AI coding tools, but requires some supervision: an AI is likely to add a lot of complexity to get something that works, and what we want here is the simplest possible approach to get a non-trivial result.

Once you've implemented a baseline strategy, update the TUTORIAL.md to instruct students to implement the baseline strategy. If the baseline strategy feels like too much code to put in-line in the tutorial, then it's probably too complicated!

## 5. Verify that it's working

To verify that all of this is working, have an AI agent complete the tutorial, using a prompt like this.

```
Do the TUTORIAL.md to see if everything works. Instead of using VS Code dev container, just use `make run-interactive` and run your notebook in the docker container. 
```

If that works, go through the tutorial yourself to see if you run into any issues.

## 6. Update the README

Update the README to describe the project, if this hasn't already been done.

## 7. Delete this file

You're done! You can delete this PROJECT_SETUP.md file.
